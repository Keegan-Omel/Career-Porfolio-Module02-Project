            <h2 title="Hi, I'm Keegan Omel, a father of two amazing children - a boy and a girl. When I'm not spending time with my family, you can find me immersing myself in the world of technology and constantly learning new skills as a junior developer. I find coding to be incredibly rewarding, as it allows me to use my creativity to solve real-world problems.

            In addition to coding, I have a passion for music and play the drums in my free time. I also love gardening and find the process of nurturing plants and watching them grow to be incredibly satisfying. And, of course, I'm a huge fan of comedy - there's nothing like a good laugh to brighten up the day.
            
            As a junior developer, I am excited to continue developing my skills and contributing to the world of technology. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact on people's lives, and I am committed to doing my part to make that happen.">About Me</h2>
